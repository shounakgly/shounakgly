## Welcome 👋
Hi! My name is Shounak, and I'm a Technical Writer. 

For the last six years, I've been working in the fields of Technical Writing, Content Design, and Product Support. Through my education and work, I've picked up skills in researching, information mapping, writing, quality testing, and editing technical information into user-friendly content.

The following are a few details about me.

✍ I love the process of writing to find the simplest and most effective way to turn information into words. You can check out my [Technical Writing Portfolio](https://github.com/shounakgly/technical-writing-portfolio#technical-writing-portfolio) to see my writing and content samples.

🌱 I enjoy learning and growing my skills. I'm currently brushing up my skills in API documentation and refreshing my knowledge in Instructional Design.

📹 Prior to becoming a Technical Writer, I was a media professional. I still put some of my media skills to use in turning complex documentation into easy-to-follow videos and tutorials to help evangelize and troubleshoot products.
